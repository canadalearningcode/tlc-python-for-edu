      #Contingency

      * If you do not have access to wifi, use a USB or other method to get learner files onto all computers.
      * Skip creating Trinket accounts.
      * Starter projects are included in the learner download files > `contingency` folder.
      * Open the HTML files in your browser to view instructions and edit offline.

      #Specific Examples + Instructions

      ##Do the Robot (slide 8)
      Follow the Do the Robot [lesson plan](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/lessons/do-the-robot/), including the extensions. Recommended tasks: High-five, Jumping Jack

      ##Assessment (slide 33)
      *[Socrative](https://socrative.com/) or [Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/go/)* can be used to check for understanding. These tools are for creating interactive digital quizzes.

      *Success criteria* is a list of features that should be included in a project - sort of like a checklist that is shared with learners ahead of time to set clear expectations.

      *Co-creating* means the learners give input on what these features are, and how their projects will be evaluated.

      *Peer evaluations* are when learners are provided with success criteria (usually in the form of a rubric) and assess each other's projects.

      *A Gallery Walk* is when learners have their projects displayed at their desk or at a station, and learners move around the classroom freely to look at each other's projects - like an Art Gallery.

      ##Lesson Planning (slide 56)
      Give learners 45 minutes to lesson plan either on their own or in pairs. You may want to move learners based off of grade levels or subject areas so that they can collaborate with educators of a similar focus.

      ##Show and Tell (slide 57)
      Save time for volunteers to share what they are working on (doesn't need to be finished!)

      ##Next Steps (slide 46)
      Encourage learners to write their next step on a post-it note and stick it on a wall before leaving.

      **Suggest that learners create a trinket account prior to the workshop, to save time.**

      *Code Along (slide 19)**: For this brief workshop, complete the first three Code Along "Getting Started with Python Turtle" activities, but skip the challenges to save time for the main project.
