      #Specific Examples + Instructions
      This workshop works well with learners grouped at tables around the room
      It's a good idea to position a mentor at or near each table of learners.

      ##Do the Robot (slide 8)
      Follow the Do the Robot [lesson plan](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/lessons/do-the-robot/), including the extensions. Recommended tasks: High-five, Jumping Jack

      ##Code Along (Slide 20)
      Encourage learners to put their laptops int pizza/politeness mode (screens down, eyes forward) as you go through this first code along, so you have their full attention.
      Encourage learners to choose *one* of the code along activities to complete, if they are finished early, encourage them to try the other problem.

      ##Turtle Art
      Pizza mode while introducing todays project, showing example project so learners can see what they are working towards
      Encourage learners to work ahead if they want to
      Remind learners that they should be typing instead of copy/pasting

      ##Using Trinket:
      Some learners may find it confusing to have to copy/paste their code from section to section during the trinket workshop.
      Encourage learners to open up a new trinket (In trinket, click your username in the top right and then select new trinket) and the workshop instructions side by side on their screen in 2 browser windows.
      This way, then can follow along and be sure they havent missed anything.

      ##Lesson Planning (slide 26)
      Give learners 20-30 minutes to lesson plan either on their own or in pairs.
      You may want to move learners based off of grade levels or subject areas so that they can collaborate with educators of a similar focus.

      ##Code Along 2 (slide 29)
      Once again, encourage learners to enter pizza/politeness mode while you go through this code along, since processing is a little more complicated.
      Give time after for learners to work on this portion.

      ##Magic 8 ball
      Pizza mode while introducing todays project, showing example project so learners can see what they are working towards
      Encourage learners to work ahead if they want to.
      Encourage learners to brainstorm ideas for responses with their table-mates
      Remind learners that they should be typing instead of copy/pasting

      ##Show and Tell (slide 57)
      Save time for volunteers to share what they are working on (doesn't need to be finished!)

      ##Next Steps (slide 46)
      Encourage learners to write their next step on a post-it note and stick it on a wall before leaving.

      #Specific Examples + Instructions

      * Suggest that learners create a trinket account prior to the workshop, to save time.

      * Code Along: For this brief workshop, complete the first three Code Along "Getting Started with Python Turtle" activities, but consider skipping the challenges to save time for the project.
