      #Specific Examples + Instructions
      This workshop works well with learners grouped at tables around the room
      It's a good idea to position a mentor at or near each table of learners.

      ##Do the Robot (slide 8)
      Follow the Do the Robot [lesson plan](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/lessons/do-the-robot/), including the extensions. Recommended tasks: High-five, Jumping Jack.

      ##Code Along (Slide 20)
      Encourage learners to put their laptops into pizza/politeness mode (screens down, eyes forward) as you go through this first code along, so you have their full attention.

      Encourage learners to choose *one* of the code along activities to complete, if they are finished early, encourage them to try the other problem.

      ##Turtle Art (Slide 22)
      Pizza mode while introducing today's project, showing example project so learners can see what they are working towards.

      Encourage learners to work ahead if they want to.

      Remind learners that they should be typing instead of copy/pasting, in order to get used to the syntax (rules) of the Python language.

      ##Using Trinket:
      Some learners may find it confusing to have to copy/paste their code from section to section during the trinket workshop.

      Encourage learners to open up a new trinket (In trinket, click your username in the top right and then select new trinket) and the workshop instructions side by side on their screen in 2 browser windows.

      This way, then can follow along and be sure they haven't missed anything.

      ##Lesson Planning (slide 31)
      Give learners 20-30 minutes to lesson plan either on their own or in pairs.
      You may want to move learners based off of grade levels or subject areas so that they can collaborate with educators of a similar focus.

      ##Show and Tell (slide 32)
      Save time for volunteers to share what they are working on (doesn't need to be finished!)

      ##Code Along 2 (slide 33)
      Once again, encourage learners to enter pizza/politeness mode while you go through this code along, since processing is a little more complicated.

      Give time for learners to experiment by changing parts of their code then running the trinket. Ask for volunteers to share how they solved the challenges.

      ##Magic 8 Ball (Slide 35)
      Pizza mode while introducing and showing the example project so learners can see what they are working towards.

      Encourage learners to work ahead if they want to.

      Encourage learners to brainstorm ideas for responses with their table-mates.

      Remind learners that they should be typing instead of copy/pasting.

      ##Assessment (slide 41)
      * [Socrative](https://socrative.com/) or [Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/go/)* can be used to check for understanding. These tools are for creating interactive digital quizzes.
      * Success criteria* is a list of features that should be included in a project - sort of like a checklist that is shared with learners ahead of time to set clear expectations.
      * Co-creating* means the learners give input on what these features are, and how their projects will be evaluated.
      * Peer evaluations* are when learners are provided with success criteria (usually in the form of a rubric) and assess each other's projects.
      * A Gallery Walk is when learners have their projects displayed at their desk or at a station, and learners move around the classroom freely to look at each other's projects - like an Art Gallery.

      ##Next Steps (slide 42)
      Encourage learners to write their next step on a post-it note and stick it on a wall before leaving.

      #Contingency

      * The internet is required for this workshop, to access Trinket.
      * If you have internet connectivity issues, you can use the **Coding with Chrome** extension ([download here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/coding-with-chrome/becloognjehhioodmnimnehjcibkloed/related)) offline for the first (Turtle Art) activity only.
        1. Launch App <br> ![launch](framework/img/workshop/cwc-launch.png)
        1. Select 'Advanced' <br> ![launch](framework/img/workshop/cwc-advanced.png)
        1. Select 'Programming' > 'Python' > 'Turtle Graphics' <br> ![launch](framework/img/workshop/cwc-programming-python.png)
        1. Remove the code (everything under the first two lines) and type your new code here <br> ![launch](framework/img/workshop/cwc-turtle-new.png)
      * The Turtle Art instructions are saved in the learner files as `turtle-art-contingency` with each activity numbered in order of how it appears in the Trinket course.
      * These pages can be viewed offline in the browser (double-click the .html files to open), however, they are not linked and learners will need to open each file individually.

      For this brief workshop, complete the first three Code Along "Getting Started with Python Turtle" activities, but consider skipping the challenges to save time for the project.
